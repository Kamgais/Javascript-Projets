            These are short, famous texts in English from 
            classic sources like the Bible or Shakespeare.
             Some texts have word definitions and explanations
              to help you. Some of these texts are written in 
              an old style of English. Try to understand them,
               because the English that we speak today is based 
               on what our great, great, great, great grandparents 
               spoke before! Of course, not all these texts 
               were originally written in English. The Bible,
                for example, is a translation. But they are 
                all well known in English today,
             and many of them express beautiful thoughts.
